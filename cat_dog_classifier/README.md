Cat and Dog Image Classifier
This project is a cat and dog image classifier that uses deep learning to classify images of cats and dogs. The code is written in Python and uses the Keras library for building and training the neural network.

Requirements
This project requires the following libraries:

Keras
Scikit-learn
OpenCV
Numpy
Google Colab
Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1.Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
2.Copy and paste the code into the notebook.
3.Mount your Google Drive by running the command drive.mount('/content/gdrive').
4.Modify the folder_path variable to point to the directory containing your training images.
5.Modify the test_image_path variable to point to the image you want to classify.
6.Run the notebook to train the model and classify the test image.
When you run the notebook, it will train the neural network on the images in the specified directory. After training is complete, it will use the model to classify the test image.

7.If the image is classified as a cat, the program will output "this is a cat". If the image is classified as a dog, the program will output "this is a dog".

Neural Network Architecture
The neural network used in this project has the following architecture:

Conv2D layer with 32 filters and a 3x3 kernel size, followed by a ReLU activation function.
MaxPooling2D layer with a 2x2 pool size.
Conv2D layer with 64 filters and a 3x3 kernel size, followed by a ReLU activation function.
MaxPooling2D layer with a 2x2 pool size.
Conv2D layer with 128 filters and a 3x3 kernel size, followed by a ReLU activation function.
MaxPooling2D layer with a 2x2 pool size.
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.25.
Flatten layer to flatten the output of the previous layer.
Dense layer with 128 neurons and a ReLU activation function.
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.4.
Dense layer with 2 neurons and a softmax activation function.
Training
The model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 16. The loss function used is binary crossentropy, and the optimizer used is Adam. The accuracy of the model on the test set is displayed after each epoch. The final weights of the model are saved to a file named "weights.h5" in your Google Drive.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use deep learning to classify images of cats and dogs. By modifying the folder_path variable, you can train the model on your own dataset of cat and dog images. By modifying the test_image_path variable, you can classify your own images of cats and dogs.
