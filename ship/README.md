2D Ship Battle Game
This is a 2D ship battle game where the player controls a ship on the left side of the screen and tries to defeat an enemy ship on the right side of the screen. The player-controlled ship can fire its cannon with the up arrow and move left or right with the left and right arrow keys, respectively.

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The ship and enemy images are set as background images using CSS. The game also features a water background and a border around the game area to enhance the player experience.

Game Objective
The objective of the game is to defeat the enemy ship on the right side of the screen by firing the player-controlled ship's cannon. The player loses the game if the enemy ship gets too close to the player or if the enemy ship completely touches the player's ship.

Game Controls
Left Arrow Key: Move the player-controlled ship to the left.
Right Arrow Key: Move the player-controlled ship to the right.
Up Arrow Key: Fire the player-controlled ship's cannon.
Game Mechanics
The enemy ship moves towards the player-controlled ship from the right side of the screen.
The player-controlled ship's cannon fires a bullet towards the enemy ship.
If the bullet hits the enemy ship, the enemy's health is reduced.
If the enemy's health reaches zero, the enemy is defeated, and the game is won.
If the enemy ship collides with the player-controlled ship, the player loses the game.
Game Development
This game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game elements such as the player-controlled ship and the enemy ship are set as div elements, and their positions are changed using JavaScript. The game also features a bullet div element that is fired when the player presses the up arrow key. The bullet's position is continuously updated, and its collision with the enemy ship is detected using JavaScript.

The game also features an interval that updates the enemy ship's position, making it move towards the player-controlled ship. If the enemy ship collides with the player-controlled ship, the game is over. The player's health is not visible on the screen, but it decreases by one every time the enemy ship collides with the player-controlled ship.

This 2D ship battle game is a fun and exciting way to spend your time. The game's objective is clear, and the game mechanics are easy to understand. The player-controlled ship's movements are smooth and responsive, and firing the cannon is satisfying.
